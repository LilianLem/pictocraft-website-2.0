# PictoCraft Website 2.0

This project is a complete rewrite of the current online website, powered by Symfony. It has started in 2022 and is currently in standby, because there are a LOT of features to work on (I feel really overwhelmed by it to be honest).

The original project was built with no guidelines, which made the code inconsistent and its quality random, because the first bit of code was written in 2017, and then got new features and pages with the time, along with my learning of PHP. I'm still adding, to this day, features when I feel the need to, and trying to improve the code when possible (procedural to functions and OOP, more security...).

However, I'm still not confident to publish it because I'm not 100% sure my old code is safe. I will look at that when the time comes. For now, if you want to view a part of it, please reach out to me.
